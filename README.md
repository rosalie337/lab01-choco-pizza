## REACT Chocolate Pizza: Refactor a webpage into React

**Assignment Overview**

Refactor your old chocolate pizza app. Choose one of the pair's `chocolate-pizza` work as a starting point and in a new repo work on separate branches and use PRs to get work into master. Trade off navigator/driver roles about every 30 minutes.  Use all the old assets from the old lab.

**GitHub Repository & Project Setup**

Create a new repository for today called **chocolate-pizza-react**. Since you're both going to be coding on the same repo, have one user give the other access to their git repo so that you can get some practice in your Git processes. Be sure to do frequent commits, and always do your work on branches. Before starting coding, think about a strategy for approaching this project. Before writing code, think about a practical order in which to do the work.

***PLAN YOUR WORK AND WORK YOUR PLAN***

When finished, deploy on netlify. Simply point netlify to your chocolate pizza repo, and it should deploy correctly :)
